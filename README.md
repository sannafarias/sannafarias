## Hi everyone 👋

My name is Sanna and I'm beginner in programming since July/2025. 

Before stepping into the world of programming, I built my career in the commercial field, with over 12 years of experience in sales, team leadership, and growth strategies.

- 👩‍💻 Since 2023, I’ve been working as a Solution Consultant, focused on technical sales and delivering SaaS software demonstrations. While looking for ways to improve my performance in this role, I realized that learning to code would be essential — and that’s what brought me here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java and Python.
- 🔭 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner front-end projects, HTML/CSS, Java and Python challenges, and initiatives that connect technology and business.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with best practices in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and code organization.
- 💬 Ask me about B2B sales, outbound prospecting, process optimization, commercial team leadership, ux, data, digital transformation, Startup ecosystem and career transition.
- 📫 How to reach me: sanna.santos@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I became a mother at 16, and that fueled my drive for growth. I became a saleswoman who decided to learn programming to better understand the product I sell — and I’m loving every bug along the way 😅
